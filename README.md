This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle error in HTML and JavaScript interaction. The bug involves an incorrect way to select an element using `document.getElementsByTagName()`, which returns a collection, not a single element.  The solution provides the corrected approach using `document.getElementById()` for selecting elements by ID, ensuring the intended behavior is achieved.  This is crucial for dynamic updates in web pages.
